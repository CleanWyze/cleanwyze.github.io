        <p>We provide professional exterior house washing services for any type of material. Whether your home's
            exterior is made of brick, stucco, vinyl, or wood, we can make it shine!</p>
        <p>Our procedures are tailored based on the material that we are washing. For instance, building exteriors
            such
            as stucco and vinyl can easily be damaged by high pressure. Keep reading to learn more about how we
            tailor

    <div id="no-power-washing" class="section">
        <h2>Pressure Washing is a Thing of the Past</h2>
        <p>Here at <strong>Clean Wyze</strong>, we soft wash the exterior of all our homes. Pressure washing can
            cause
            unwanted damage to vinyl siding and only temporarily cleans the mold off of your home.</p>
        <p>The detergents that we use totally remove the mildew and mold from your house — down to the spores.
            Included
            in
            your house wash, we also clean the soffits, trim, gutters, and fascias.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="soft-washing-benefits" class="section">
        <h2 style="color: #2c3e50;">Why Choose Soft Washing?</h2>
        <p>Soft washing your home offers a gentler, safer, and more effective cleaning method than traditional
            pressure
            washing, protecting delicate surfaces, eliminating mold and mildew, and extending the lifespan of your
            home's
            exterior.</p>

        <h3>Here's a more detailed look at the benefits:</h3>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
            <li><strong>Safer for Delicate Surfaces:</strong> Soft washing uses low-pressure water and biodegradable
                cleaning solutions, making it ideal for fragile surfaces like wood siding, stucco, and shingles.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Effective Mold and Mildew Removal:</strong> Soft washing solutions contain biocides that
                kill
                and
                remove mold, mildew, algae, and organic matter—protecting your home's health and appearance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Long-Lasting Clean:</strong> Soft washing provides a deeper clean that lasts longer than
                pressure
                washing by addressing the root cause of staining.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Most soft washing solutions are biodegradable and less harmful to the
                environment compared to typical pressure washing chemicals.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Improves Curb Appeal:</strong> A clean, well-maintained exterior significantly boosts your
                home's
                visual appeal and value.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Extends Lifespan of Home Surfaces:</strong> Regular soft washing helps preserve your siding,
                roof,
                and other surfaces by removing damaging contaminants.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Reduces Risk of Damage:</strong> Its gentle method minimizes the risk of costly surface
                damage,
                especially on older or delicate homes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cleans Hard-to-Reach Areas:</strong> Perfect for tricky spots like roofs, eaves, and corners
                that
                high-pressure washing often misses.
            </li>

        <div id="algae-101">
            <h1>Roof Algae 101</h1>
            <p>
                The unsightly dark areas of your roof are likely a type of blue green algae known as <strong
                    class="algae">Gloeocapsa
                Magma</strong>.
                It releases spores that easily travel from roof to roof, which can wreak havoc on an entire
                neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roof algae thrives in high humidity, damp areas which are usually shaded. You may notice that the north
                side
                of your home or building contains the most green areas. That is because the north side of your structure
                gets
                the least amount of sunlight.
            </p>

        <div id="algae-and-limestone">
            <h2>Algae and Limestone: A Moisture Trap</h2>
            <p>Algae cannot live on limestone alone — it also needs water. Algae has an amazing ability to trap and
                retain
                moisture in the right conditions.</p>
            <p>This damage to your roof can impact your cooling costs, as the moisture in the algae traps heat along
                with
                moisture.</p>

            <p>Our procedures are tailored based on the material that we are washing. For instance, building

        </div>
        <div id="hardyboard-washing">
            <h2>Hardyboard and Wood Clapboard Washing</h2>
            <p>Hardy board and wood clapboard is a little more tricky. We have to consider the type, age, condition
                of
                the
                wood, including any paint or finish that is already on the wood.</p>
            <p>In many cases, the wood or paint is not durable enough to use high pressure. We soft wash these
                surfaces
                all
                the time and get great results.</p>
            <p>Read the paragraph above to learn more about soft washing.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="brick-washing">
            <h2>Brick Washing</h2>
            <p>Brick is a very durable material that can safely withstand high temperatures and pressure when
                compared
                to
                other exterior materials.</p>
            <p>That doesn't mean that we go with the nuclear option from the get-go. Instead of just power-blasting
                your
                surfaces clean, we let it soak in solution in order to penetrate and pre-dissolve the nasty
                stuff.</p>
            <p>This ensures that we don't have to apply surface-damaging levels of pressure to get the job done.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="stucco-washing">
            <h2>Stucco and Vinyl Washing</h2>
            <p>Stucco and vinyl siding are much more prone to damage, so we use a process called softwashing. Hot
                temperatures can damage stucco and vinyl, so the water that we use is cold.</p>
            <p>Cleaning more delicate materials such as these is best done with soaking and chemicals, not pressure.
                We
                use
                a perfect blend of chemical concentration, soak time, and light pressure in order to effectively
                clean
                these
                surfaces without doing any damage.</p>
            <p>The detergents that we use contain surfactants and rinse aides, similar to a dishwashing liquid. It
                works
                great on windows and siding. We also utilize algicide which helps to prevent the growth of more
                algae in
                the
                future.</p>
